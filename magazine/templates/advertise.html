The Advocate is Harvard's oldest publication. Literary luminaries like T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings, Conrad Aiken, John Ashbery, James Agee, and many more were first published in the Advocate.

We print on high quality paper with heavy stock binding, ensuring the magazine's longevity. The Advocate remains a centerpiece on coffee tables for months.

The Advocate is distributed to every dorm room at Harvard as well as to our academic reception areas and libraries. Issues are mailed nationwide to subscribers, bringing our readership to over 10,000.
